**Before you begin two most important points to note**
Why You May Encounter Variations in Output When Running the Same Code from this Book in Jupy-ter Notebook: When using the OpenAI API to run a model, you often receive similar but slightly different results due to the inherent stochasticity or randomness in the generation process. OpenAI's language models, like GPT-3 and GPT-4, employ a technique called "sampling" to generate text. During sampling, the model considers multiple possible next words or tokens at each step and selects one based on probabilities. This probabilistic nature means that even with the same prompt, minor variations in the initial conditions, such as the internal model state or the random seed, can lead to different choices being made at each step of text gen-eration.
As a result, when you run the same prompt multiple times, you're likely to receive variations in the generated text. This can be beneficial because it allows for diversity in responses and can help you explore different an-gles or ideas related to your query. However, it's essential to be aware of this variability, and all the codes dis-cussed in this book may give you slightly different output than the output you obtain when you run them. You can control the level of randomness or creativity by adjusting parameters like the "temperature" in the API re-quest, where higher values lead to more randomness, and lower values produce more deterministic outputs. 

**OpenAI released version 1.0:** On November 8, 2023, OpenAI released version 1.0. However, most of the codes on GitHub (I will show you how to access vast repositories of code on GitHub in advanced lessons) are still running on old versions. For a beginner, migrating all the codes to the new version would be extremely hard. Please follow all my codes on this Github repository and I will update codes on a regular basis. Also please join our Discord  Channel  where I will give you all updates on regular basis.  Please visit https://www.chatgpthero.io/ for all the links provided in this book.  For more information about the OpenAI latest version please visit https://github.com/openai/openai-python/discussions/742.




**Sample Code:**
```python
!pip install openai 
from openai import OpenAI

# Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key from OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key = 'your api key', )
# Chain of thought prompting
chain_of_thought = (
    "Prompt 1: The shopkeeper starts with 50 apples.\n"
    "Prompt 2: In the morning, he sells 20 apples.\n"
    "Prompt 3: In the afternoon, he sells 15 more apples.\n"
    "Prompt 4: How many apples does he have left at the end of the day?"
)

# Make the API call to GPT-3.5 to get a response
response = client.completions.create(
        model="text-davinci-002",
        prompt=chain_of_thought,
        temperature=0.7,
        max_tokens=100,
        #stop=["\n"]
    )
print(response.choices[0].text.strip())
## üõ†Ô∏è **Software and Hardware List**
For executing the code, you can either use **Google Colab** or install **Anaconda** to run the codes on Jupyter notebooks.
